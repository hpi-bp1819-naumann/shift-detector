its parent."
105,106,Hitmonlee,Fighting,,455,50,120,53,35,110,87,1,False,"Hitmonlee’s legs freely contract and stretch. Using these

108,109,Koffing,Poison,,340,40,65,95,60,45,35,1,False,"Koffing embodies toxic substances. It mixes the toxins with raw
garbage to set off a chemical reaction that results in a terribly
powerful poison gas. The higher the temperature, the more gas

109,110,Weezing,Poison,,490,65,90,120,85,70,60,1,False,"Weezing alternately shrinks and inflates its twin bodies to mix

becomes more putrid."
110,111,Rhyhorn,Ground,Rock,345,80,85,95,30,30,25,1,False,"Rhyhorn’s brain is very small. It is so dense, while on a run

next day."
114,115,Kangaskhan,Normal,,490,105,95,80,40,80,90,1,False,"Kangaskhan protects its child by keeping it in

its prey before eating."
