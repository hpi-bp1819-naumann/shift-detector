garbage to set off a chemical reaction that results in a terribly
powerful poison gas. The higher the temperature, the more gas
is concocted by this Pokémon."
110,Weezing,Poison,,490,65,90,120,85,70,60,1,False,"Weezing alternately shrinks and inflates its twin bodies to mix
together toxic gases inside. The more the gases are mixed,
the more powerful the toxins become. The Pokémon also
becomes more putrid."
111,Rhyhorn,Ground,Rock,345,80,85,95,30,30,25,1,False,"Rhyhorn’s brain is very small. It is so dense, while on a run
it forgets why it started running in the first place. It apparently
remembers sometimes if it demolishes something."
112,Rhydon,Ground,Rock,485,105,130,120,45,45,40,1,False,"Rhydon has a horn that serves as a drill. It is used for
destroying rocks and boulders. This Pokémon occasionally
rams into streams of magma, but the armor-like hide prevents
it from feeling the heat."
113,Chansey,Normal,,450,250,5,5,35,105,50,1,False,"It seems that other Pokémon’s efforts to take
its delicious, nutritious egg away from it caused
Chansey to get faster at fleeing."
114,Tangela,Grass,,435,65,55,115,100,40,60,1,False,"Tangela’s vines snap off easily if they are grabbed. This

next day."

black ink from its mouth and try to escape. This Pokémon
swims by cleverly flapping the fin on its back."
117,Seadra,Water,,440,55,65,95,95,45,85,1,False,"Seadra generates whirlpools by spinning its body.
The whirlpools are strong enough to swallow even
fishing boats. This Pokémon weakens prey with
these currents, then swallows it whole."
118,Goldeen,Water,,320,45,67,60,35,50,63,1,False,"Although known for their splendid tail fins,
Goldeen apparently compete among themselves
to see whose horn is thickest and sharpest."
119,Seaking,Water,,450,80,92,65,65,80,68,1,False,"Its horn spins like a drill to steadily hollow out
rocks—even harder ones. The coloration of the
male is more vivid."

falling into the ocean and becoming Staryu."
121,Starmie,Water,Psychic,520,60,75,85,100,85,115,1,False,"Its sparkling core is called “the gem of the sea.”

accessories that are traded in secret."

123,Scyther,Bug,Flying,500,70,110,80,55,80,105,1,False,"Its two sharp scythes are more than just

its prey before eating."
124,Jynx,Ice,Psychic,455,65,50,35,115,95,95,1,False,"It sways its hips to a rhythm all its own. The
precise movements of Jynx living in Alola are
truly wonderful."

For some reason, it apparently gets along well
with Heracross in Alola."
128,Tauros,Normal,,490,75,100,95,40,70,110,1,False,"They live in groups. The one with the longest,

of transportation over water."
132,Ditto,Normal,,288,48,48,48,48,48,48,1,False,"While it can transform into anything, each Ditto
apparently has its own strengths and
weaknesses when it comes to transformations."

unstable genes has still not been solved."
134,Vaporeon,Water,,525,130,65,60,110,95,65,1,False,"Clean, clear waters are its usual habitat. When

it dives into the water to hide."
135,Jolteon,Electric,,525,65,65,60,110,95,130,1,False,"Its lungs contain an organ that creates

137,Porygon,Normal,,395,65,60,70,85,75,40,1,False,"This Pokémon was created using the

many parts of it have since become obsolete."
138,Omanyte,Rock,Water,355,35,40,100,90,55,35,1,False,"Omanyte lived in the seas of antiquity. Its

Archeops, so apparently Archeops preyed on it."
139,Omastar,Rock,Water,495,70,60,125,115,70,55,1,False,"Its heavy shell is thought to be the reason this
ancient Pokémon died out. It’s apparently a
distant ancestor of Octillery."
140,Kabuto,Rock,Water,355,30,80,90,55,45,55,1,False,"This Pokémon thrived 300 million years ago. It’s

though, it apparently displays awesome power."

147,Dratini,Dragon,,300,41,64,45,50,50,50,1,False,"It’s still weak, so it lurks on the floor of bodies
of water, eating whatever food sinks down and
living a quiet life."
148,Dragonair,Dragon,,420,61,84,65,70,70,70,1,False,"Lakes where Dragonair live are filled with

Pokémon is able to control the weather."

Pokémon “the sea incarnate.”"
150,Mewtwo,Psychic,,680,106,110,90,154,90,130,1,True,"Mewtwo is a Pokémon that was created by genetic
manipulation. However, even though the scientific power
of humans created this Pokémon’s body, they failed to
endow Mewtwo with a compassionate heart."
151,Mew,Psychic,,600,100,100,100,100,100,100,1,False,"Mew is said to possess the genetic composition of all
Pokémon. It is capable of making itself invisible at will,
so it entirely avoids notice even if it approaches people."
152,Chikorita,Grass,,318,45,49,65,49,65,45,2,False,"In battle, Chikorita waves its leaf around to keep the foe at

155,Cyndaquil,Fire,,309,39,52,43,60,50,65,2,False,"Cyndaquil protects itself by flaring up the flames on its back.

156,Quilava,Fire,,405,58,64,58,80,65,80,2,False,"Quilava keeps its foes at bay with the intensity of its flames

159,Croconaw,Water,,405,65,80,80,59,63,58,2,False,"Once Croconaw has clamped its jaws on its foe, it will
absolutely not let go. Because the tips of its fangs are

incapable of sleep due to fear."
162,Furret,Normal,,415,85,76,64,45,55,90,2,False,"Furret has a very slim build. When under attack, it can slickly
squirm through narrow spaces and get away. In spite of its
short limbs, this Pokémon is very nimble and fleet."
163,Hoothoot,Normal,Flying,262,60,30,30,36,56,50,2,False,"Every day, it tilts its head in the same rhythm.

luminescent effect is produced."
172,Pichu,Electric,,205,20,40,15,35,35,60,2,False,"It still can’t use electricity well. When it’s
surprised or excited, it discharges
electricity unintentionally."
173,Cleffa,Fairy,,218,50,25,28,45,55,15,2,False,"On nights with many shooting stars,
they gather in packs and dance in circles. If you

175,Togepi,Fairy,,245,35,20,65,40,65,20,2,False,"As its energy, Togepi uses the positive emotions of
compassion and pleasure exuded by people and Pokémon.

then shares them with others."

charged with static electricity, so a special
process is used on it."
180,Flaaffy,Electric,,365,70,55,55,80,60,45,2,False,"In the places on its body where fleece doesn’t
grow, its skin is rubbery and doesn’t conduct
electricity. Those spots are safe to touch."
181,Ampharos,Electric,,510,90,75,85,115,90,55,2,False,"The light from its tail can be seen from space.
This is why you can always tell exactly where it

the treetops."
191,Sunkern,Grass,,180,30,30,30,30,30,30,2,False,"Sunkern tries to move as little as it possibly can. It does so

morning dew."

Destiny Bond."
203,Girafarig,Normal,Psychic,455,70,80,65,90,65,85,2,False,"Girafarig’s rear head contains a tiny brain that is too small for

209,Snubbull,Fairy,,300,60,80,50,40,40,30,2,False,"It grows close to others easily and is also easily
spoiled. The disparity between its face and its
actions makes many young people wild about it."
210,Granbull,Fairy,,450,90,120,75,60,60,45,2,False,"While it has powerful jaws, it doesn’t care for

their might."
