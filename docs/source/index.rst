Welcome to morpheus
===================

    **Remember: all I'm offering is the truth. Nothing more.**

morpheus is a framework for :term:`shift` detection. It unifies several methods
to systematically compare data sets into an easy-to-use interface.

Get started with :ref:`installation` and then get an overview with
the :ref:`quickstart`. The rest of the docs describe each component
of morpheus in detail, with a full reference in the :ref:`api` section.
