Welcome to Icarus
=================

Icarus is a framework for shift detection. It unifies several methods
to systematically compare data sets into an easy-to-use interface.

Get started with :ref:`installation` and then get an overview with
the :ref:`quickstart`. There is also a more detailed :ref:`tutorial`
that shows a small but complete use case for Icarus. The rest of the
docs describe each component of Icarus in detail, with a full
reference in the :ref:`api` section.
