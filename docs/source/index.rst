Welcome to Morpheus
===================

    **Remember: all I'm offering is the truth. Nothing more.**

Morpheus is a framework for shift detection. It unifies several methods
to systematically compare data sets into an easy-to-use interface.

Get started with :ref:`installation` and then get an overview with
the :ref:`quickstart`. There is also a more detailed :ref:`tutorial`
that shows a small but complete use case for Morpheus. The rest of the
docs describe each component of Morpheus in detail, with a full
reference in the :ref:`api` section.
