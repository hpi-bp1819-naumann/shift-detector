Morpheus comprises several methods to systematically compare two
data sets and check for shifts. This section introduces each of
those methods, which we call :term:`check`.

For each check we give details about:

- Why is it included?
- What kind of shifts can be detected?
- How does it work?
- What input is required?
- How does the output look?
- How is it implemented?
